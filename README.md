CustomToken Smart Contract
The CustomToken smart contract is a basic implementation of a token contract on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows for the creation, minting, and burning of custom tokens.

Description
The CustomToken smart contract is written in Solidity and provides the following functionalities:

It stores basic details about the token, including its name, abbreviation, and total supply.
It maintains a mapping of addresses to token balances.
It allows the owner of the contract to mint new tokens, increasing the total supply and the balance of a specified address.
It allows the owner of the contract to burn (destroy) tokens, reducing the total supply and deducting the burned amount from the balance of a specified address.
Usage
Deployment
To deploy the CustomToken contract on the Ethereum blockchain, follow these steps:

Compile the contract using a Solidity compiler such as Remix or Truffle.
Deploy the compiled contract to an Ethereum network of your choice (e.g., Mainnet, Ropsten, Rinkeby) using a tool like Remix or Truffle.
Minting Tokens
The mint function allows the contract owner to mint new tokens and increase the balance of a specified address. Here's how to use it:

Call the mint function with the target address and the amount of tokens to be minted.
Ensure that the specified amount is greater than 0.
The total supply and the balance of the specified address will be increased by the minted amount.
Burning Tokens
The burn function allows the contract owner to burn (destroy) tokens and deduct the burned amount from the total supply and the balance of a specified address. Here's how to use it:

Call the burn function with the target address and the amount of tokens to be burned.
Ensure that the specified amount is greater than 0 and that the balance of the target address is sufficient.
The total supply and the balance of the specified address will be reduced by the burned amount.
